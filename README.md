Fork&Spoon
--------

**Description**

Fork&Spoon gives single eaters the exciting option to anonymously invite one other eater to join them on their dining festivities within the San Francisco Bay Area. 

**How It Works**

Fork&Spoon uses Google Maps and Yelp so users can quickly find and select nearby places while choosing a date and time that suits them best. Other single eaters can choose from a list of available outings; when they choose an outing, a text message is sent via Twilio. Voil√†! A meal date for two has been made! Users now have the chance to meet and eat with new individuals while exploring the places they've always wanted to try. 

### Technology Stack
